# Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning
## Introduction
This project builds a **machine learning–based laptop price prediction system** using real-world laptop specifications. The objective is to analyze how hardware, display, and software features influence laptop pricing and to compare multiple regression models to identify the most effective approach.

The notebook follows a **complete end-to-end pipeline**, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), detailed feature cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using standard regression metrics.

## Why This Dataset?
The laptop dataset is well-suited for this problem because:
- It represents real market data with realistic pricing patterns.
- It contains a mix of categorical and numerical features, requiring extensive preprocessing.
- Pricing depends on multiple interacting components such as CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, display quality, and operating system.
- It provides an excellent opportunity to practice feature extraction from raw text data (e.g., CPU, memory, screen resolution).
